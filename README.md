## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What should I do if I encounter an error stating that the master key is missing?**

**A:** 
- Delete the existing `credentials.yml.enc` file to allow for the generation of new credentials: `rm config/credentials.yml.enc`.
- Open your credentials for editing with your preferred editor, e.g., `EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit`.
- After updating your credentials, save and close the editor to generate a new `master.key`.
- Securely configure the new `master.key` in your environment variables, but do not add it to version control.
- Remember to back up any essential data before making these changes.
